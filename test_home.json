I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a \"Fresh and Fruity\" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled \"I Scream for Quick Pops!\", \"Bake Shop\", and  \"Coco Loco\". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on \"Tips\" and \"Techniques\" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect. On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults. There are flavors like \"Cookie Dough\", \"That's a S'more\", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly. All 9 recipes in \"Bake Shop\" are inspired by cake and cookie recipes.As a resource for light, fresh-tasting fruit pop recipes, \"Zoku Quick Pops\" is very limited. Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients. The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor. The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors. Mango and orange together make a terrific pop. The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes. Tips and techniques are also useful. For fruit pop recipes, \"Top Pops\" by Emily Zaiden is far better.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Excels at Sweet Dessert Pops, but Falls Short on the Fruit Pops.", "unixReviewTime": 1367712000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2013"}

There is a helpful section called \"The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate\", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the \"it wasn't what I expected\" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas.

I have to say, however, that some of the instructions in it were contradicted by our instructor and she said she was instructed by Wilton to do so. I certainly felt that her way was better and, since it involves such basic instructions, I wanted to share it with you.For all the projects in this book other than covering the cake base and the cake itself--that is to say all the flowers, the bow, the leaves, and the borders along the bottom--wherever it says to use just gum paste, you should use a 1/2 gum paste and 1/2 fondant mix. Sure enough, it made it easier to do everything, there was less hardening and bumps, and everything looked prettier. (I had previously worked with gum paste on my own and wish I'd known this).Another thing that I noticed is that, in some cases, (especially the bow) the final product would have looked MUCH nicer if we'd made them thinner rather than as instructed in the booklet. It may be that, since this is an introductory course to forming decorations by sculpting rather than by piping, maybe they thought that thinner would have been harder to work with.But, all in all, it's a very nice reference (as well as an effective advertisement for countless Wilton products!)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Companion booklet for Level 3 Fondant & Gum Paste", "unixReviewTime": 1331596800, "reviewTime": "03 13, 2012"}
